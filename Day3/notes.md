-> MongoDB(Non SQL DB) ->they represent data in JSON file
-> collection -> group of documents
-> Document -> a representation of data in an object format
-> user = [{},{},{}], each of '{}' are documents & 'user' is a collection

-> In order to draw parallels between SQL & NoSQL
    * table in SQL is equivalent to collection in MongoDB
    * row in a SQL is equivalent to document in MongoDB
    * column in SQL is equivalent to key in MongoDB

-> We choose MongoDB if we want to do more changes in DB more frequently, here in MongoDB 'key' is very important, due to which this DB is more efficient for frequently changes as in SQL then if any changes you want to make to the table instantaneously, sometimes this need to include a 'new column' into the table, this is costly operation.
